Cloud involves numerous complicated tasks such as:-
1)Understanding hardware requirements
2)Buying required hardware
3)Setting up the infrastructure
4)Configuring the systems
5)Managing the systems

Before cloud computing was available deploying an application was a massive task.We use cloud to deploy our application.Before cloud computing an organization was required
to invest in a data center to procure some specific hardwares like servers and set up the application on those servers.So we needed to preplan things.Procurement of data
centers were time consuming and had certain limits.

Cloud computing simply removes all the roadblocks you come across when u need access to some extra computing resources.To put it simply,cloud computing refers to the 
delivery of computing services over a network to a remote customer.

Cloud computing also offers several advantages such as :-
1)On demand 
2)scalable
3)elasticity
4)Broad network access
5)Measured Services
6)Multi-Tenancy
7)Resource Pooling

Anyone can access cloud computing services anytime they need to
Before cloud computing,anyone in need of computation resources had to buy these resources and configure them which took time

Cloud computing allows you to increase the capacity of resources and services quite easily
This can be done by either horizontal scaling or vertical scaling.In horizontal scaling we add more servers to our pool(cluster) of servers
In vertical scaling we add more resources to our existing servers
Vertical scaling is all about adding extra memory or adding extra CPU power.

Cloud computing services are available to be accessed anywhere using the internet.You do not need to be on premise network to access these services.(Elastic)
You can either scale up or down depending upon the demand.When we talk about scaling,we talk about adding more processing and adding either vertical or horizontal 
scaling.In vertical scaling we talk about adding more capacity to the existing system/server.

Elasticity refers to the property that if the demand increases then you may either scale up the resources or vice-versa.
In scalability we talk about only scaling up and not scaling down but in elasticity we talk about both.

Cloud computing services are available to be accessed anywhere using the internet.You do not need to be on a special on premise network to access these services.

Cloud computing roles:-
1)Provider
2)Customer
3)Partner
4)Broker

Provider offers cloud computing services for sale to third parties
Customer purchase cloud computing services from one or more provider
Partners are third party companies that offer products and services that interact with the services offered by cloud service providers eg-Service Monitoring,etc.
Broker manages the cloud services and negotiates relationships between cloud providers and cloud customers.
To understand cloud security what is most important is that we understand basic building blocks of cloud computing.These building blocks are nothing but the infrastructure
services that make up the various cloud computing platforms.
These building blocks are:-
1)Compute service
2)Storage service
3)Networing service
4)Databases service
5)Orchestration service

Compute services refer to creation,management and usage of virtual servers which we then use to perform computation tasks.
These servers can then be used by users to offload some resource intensive taks such as calculations or application deployment etc. eg-AWS EC2-If i have set up a 
dedicated web server on Amazon AWS EC2 then it is an example of compute service.

In cloud computing storage is broken into 2 categories:Block and Object
First one is block storage in which we get a chunk of storage space allocated to us which is then partitioned into drives and managed by operating system eg:-AWS Elastic
Block Store
Second one is Object Storage which abstracts the details file storage and management,All these details are handeled by our cloud service provider,all we have to do is to
upload and access files.eg:-AWS S3

In cloud computing networks allows users to connect several systems together in cloud.
Networks in cloud are highly virtualised to provide high degree of flexibility in designing their networks to suit their own unique buisness requirements.
